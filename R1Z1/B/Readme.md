Let's break down **Example 2** step by step and explain how the solution works to fit the maximum number of words into the lines.

### Problem Recap:
You have 6 words: `["a", "is", "b", "be", "it", "a"]`
- You need to fit them into **5 lines**, each with a maximum length of **4 characters**.

### Input Details:
- **Words**: `["a", "is", "b", "be", "it", "a"]`
- **Max Lines (N)**: `5`
- **Max Line Length (M)**: `4`

### Expected Output:
- **Output**: `6`

This means we need to fit all 6 words into the lines such that each line doesn’t exceed 4 characters in length. The final output is **6**, meaning all the words can be placed successfully in the available lines.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Filter Words**: 
   - First, we remove any words that are longer than the maximum allowed line length (`M = 4`). However, in this case, all the words are 2 or 3 characters long, so no words are excluded.

   The list of words remains: `["a", "is", "b", "be", "it", "a"]`

2. **Sort Words by Length (Descending)**:
   - Although sorting isn't strictly necessary for this small example, we can still sort the words by their length in descending order to help fit larger words first. 
   - Sorted words: `["is", "be", "it", "a", "a", "b"]`

3. **Backtracking (Fitting Words to Lines)**:
   - Now we need to place these words in 5 lines where each line can hold a maximum of 4 characters, including spaces between the words.
   
   **Goal**: Fit as many words as possible within the constraints. Backtracking is used to explore different configurations of placing the words.

### Trying to Fit Words into Lines:

We have 5 lines and a maximum of 4 characters per line. Let's try placing the words one by one.

#### Step 1: Place "is" (Length 2)
- **Line 1**: `is`
  - "is" fits perfectly in the first line (2 characters).

#### Step 2: Place "be" (Length 2)
- **Line 2**: `be`
  - "be" fits perfectly in the second line (2 characters).

#### Step 3: Place "it" (Length 2)
- **Line 3**: `it`
  - "it" fits perfectly in the third line (2 characters).

#### Step 4: Place "a" (Length 1)
- **Line 1**: `is a`
  - "a" can be added to Line 1, making it `is a` (3 characters).

#### Step 5: Place "a" (Length 1)
- **Line 2**: `be a`
  - "a" can be added to Line 2, making it `be a` (3 characters).

#### Step 6: Place "b" (Length 1)
- **Line 3**: `it b`
  - "b" can be added to Line 3, making it `it b` (3 characters).

Now we’ve successfully placed all 6 words in the first three lines. However, **there are 2 remaining lines**, but they are empty because we’ve already filled 3 lines.

---

### Final Configuration:

```
Line 1: "is a"  (3 characters)
Line 2: "be a"  (3 characters)
Line 3: "it b"  (3 characters)
Line 4: (empty)
Line 5: (empty)
```

**Total Words Placed**: 6 words.

This is the maximum number of words that can be placed within the constraints.

---

### Output:
- **Output**: `6` because all the words are successfully placed within the 5 lines, even though the last 2 lines are empty.

---

### Key Insights from the Example:
- We used **backtracking** to try placing words into the lines.
- The sorting of words by length (in descending order) helped place the larger words first, which makes it easier to fit the smaller ones later.
- We made sure to add spaces between the words and ensure no line exceeded the maximum length of 4 characters.

### Pseudo-Iteration of the Process:

Here’s a simplified pseudo-iteration of the process:

1. **Word 1 ("is")**: 
   - Place in Line 1 → `is`
2. **Word 2 ("be")**: 
   - Place in Line 2 → `be`
3. **Word 3 ("it")**: 
   - Place in Line 3 → `it`
4. **Word 4 ("a")**: 
   - Add to Line 1 → `is a`
5. **Word 5 ("a")**: 
   - Add to Line 2 → `be a`
6. **Word 6 ("b")**: 
   - Add to Line 3 → `it b`

Now the program has filled all 6 words within the 5 lines, and the solution is complete.

### Conclusion:
By using **backtracking** and making sure words fit within the constraints of the available lines, we were able to place all 6 words successfully, even though some lines were left empty at the end. The output is **6**, which is the maximum number of words that can fit into the 5 lines.
